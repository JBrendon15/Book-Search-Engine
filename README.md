# Book-Search-Engine

## Description 
For this project we had to refactor code for a Google Book API. We refactored it from using Restful APIs to GraphQL useQuery and useMutation. We also connected it to an Apollo Server. Working on this project was a little bit difficult. I was not yet able to figure out how to deploy the appication.
